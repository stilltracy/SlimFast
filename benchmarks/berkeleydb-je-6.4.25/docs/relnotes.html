<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Berkeley DB Java Edition (JE) is a 100% pure Java embedded, transactional data
store. It supplies a key/object data model with indexing, full transactional
ACID support, POJO APIs and High Availability/Replication.
<p>
Note that in JE 6.0 and later, the Java compatibility requirement for JE is
Java SE 7 and the open source license is the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
<p>
JE is compatible with Java SE 7 and later, and has been tested and certified
against Oracle JDK 8u45 and IBM J9 7.0. We encourage you to upgrade to the
latest Java releases to take advantage of the latest bug fixes and performance
improvements.
<p>
Be sure to see the <a href="changelog.html">change log</a> for information
about upgrading from earlier releases.
<p>
This release contains a number of changes, including:
<ol>
    <li>
    Added an off-heap cache capability. An off-heap cache can be used to
    utilize large memories more efficiently than when using the same memory
    for the file system cache, while avoiding the Java GC overheap associated
    with large Java heaps. See the change log for a description of the current
    limitations of the off-heap cache, and a list of the API additions.  See
    the EnvironmentMutableConfig.setOffHeapCacheSize javadoc for information
    on how to enable the cache and its impact on performance.
    [#23889]
    </li>
    <li>
    Several improvements were made to DiskOrderedCursor performance and
    behavior. Read IO is reduced, memory management behavior is improved,
    there is no longer a potential data lag to the last checkpoint, and
    multiple databases may now be scanned at once.  These improvements also
    apply to Database.count, which uses the same internal scanning mechanism
    as DiskOrderedCursor.
    [#24291] [#24171] [#24192] [#24226] [#24270]
    </li>
    <li>
    Several important bugs have been fixed.
    </li>
</ol>
