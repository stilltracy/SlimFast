*** BUILDING THE CODE ***

To build all the BDB code (including the benchmark) run, from the
benchmarks/berkeleydb-je-6.4.25/ directory:

  ant

This compiles all the code into the
benchmarks/berkeleydb-je-6.4.25/build/classes/ directory. The benchmark code is
in benchmarks/berkeleydb-je-6.4.25/slimfast-benchmark/RandomReads.java.


*** RUNNING THE BENCHMARK ***

First we initialize a new database with 1,000 keys, where each key is an integer
from 0 to 999 and has a value of 64KB of (empty) data. The database will be
placed in the db1k-64kb directory.

  mkdir db1k-64kb
  java -cp $SLIMFAST_ROOT/benchmarks/berkeleydb-je-6.4.25/build/classes RandomReads insert db1k-64kb 1000 65536

Now we'll perform 5,000 sequential reads from the database we created before. The
last parameter of 1000 indicates that random keys should be in the interval
[0,1000) since those are the keys in our database.

  java -cp $SLIMFAST_ROOT/benchmarks/berkeleydb-je-6.4.25/build/classes RandomReads randomread db1k-64kb 5000 1000

In my experiments, it takes FT about 20 minutes to complete one run. SF takes a
little under 10 minutes (about 2x faster).
